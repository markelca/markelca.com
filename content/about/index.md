{{< image src="/img/profilepic.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" style="width: 200px; height: 200px; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left;" >}}I'm a software engineer based in San Sebastián (Spain), passionate about backend systems, AI, and developer tooling.

Over the last 5 years, I've worked primarily in backend engineering, focusing on REST APIs, event-driven systems, and AI-driven automation. I've built optimization algorithms for a booking allocation engine, large-scale serverless data pipelines, an enterprise-grade AI-powered automation platform, and modular, highly testable API backends.

I’m especially interested in distributed systems, high-performance applications, and tools that improve developer productivity. Lately, I’ve enjoyed experimenting with AI coding agents, guiding and supervising them through well-defined implementation plans to speed up delivery while keeping quality high.

This is the tech I'm interested in:
- **Languages:** PHP, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, C
- **Frameworks & tools:** Symfony, Nuxt, Next.js, Gin, Bubbletea
- **Architecture:** Hexagonal Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Modular Monoliths, CQRS
- **Infrastructure:** AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, SQS), Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform

I’m a bit obsessive about my developer workflow too. I enjoy customizing and optimizing my setup end-to-end, from my Linux distribution and desktop environment to terminal tooling and a heavily tailored Neovim configuration.

Outside of coding, I enjoy reading (classic literature, philosophy, psychology), training (calisthenics, running), and playing music (guitar, piano).
